#Crosswalk build scripts

This saves us from having to download a huge amount of files for crosswalk. This is incredibly useful in places where there is a bandwidth cap. Limitation is that this can and probably will be out of date pretty quickly unless someone maintains it. Truth be told, I don't plan on maintaining this repository unless someone files an issue on github.


Note that this was obtained from a crosswalk build at branch "crosswalk-16"

The gitattributes file is there to make sure the .sh file line endings aren't mangled. I could set them to binary, but I think setting shell files to binary files is pretty terrible tbh.
